          <p><b>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
Abelialeaf) </b>is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea,
where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only
seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
white, not yellow, flowers.<br><br>
It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves
are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,

pubescent both above and below. The flowers are pro-
duced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they

are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed

corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3 cm di-
ameter.<br><br>

It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North
America.</p>
